# NodeJS WebSocket Server

A simple Node.js WebSocket server and client example using the `ws` library.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a WebSocket server and client:
- The server listens for incoming WebSocket connections on port `8080`.
- The client connects to the WebSocket server, exchanges messages, and handles events.

## Features

- Establish a WebSocket connection between the client and the server.
- Send and receive messages in real-time.
- Handle client connection and disconnection events.

### Setup and Run

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piehostHQ/node-ws-server-and-client.git
   cd nodejs-websocket-server
```
Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install ws\
```
Start the WebSocket server:

```bash
node server.js
```
Open the index.html file in your web browser to connect to the WebSocket server.
